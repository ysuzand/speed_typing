# Speed-typing Challenge
WIP
## Introduction
Speed typing test websites are useful for people who want to learn to type faster, type without looking at their keyboards, practice typing specific sets of entries (think numeric tests, address test, emoji test?), or get used to a new keyboard. You will also learn how to load different data sources based on the user input, store state in the browser, and create a timer.

## Requirements
- Create a display box for a paragraph of text that the user will type
- Create an input box for the user to type the displayed text
- Highlight the character of the word users are currently typing (in the display box):
    - GREEN - letter is correct
    - RED - letter is wrong
- Create a START button for the test to begin
- Create a display box for the countdown timer
- Set a countdown time for each test
- Activate the timer when the user clicks on START
- When the timer runs out, display how many words the user typed per minute
